# Python documentation "Hash randomization is intended to provide
# protection against a denial-of-service caused by carefully-chosen
# inputs that exploit the worst case performance of a dict
# construction, O(n^2) complexity. See
# http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html for details."
# The attack case isn't relevant for code compilation and this breaks
# reproducible pycs. Setting seed to 0 is the canonical way to disable
# hash randomization
