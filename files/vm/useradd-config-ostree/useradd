# Even though we have a symlink /home -> var/home, we should not use
# /home in /etc/passwd. The real root filesystem (which is /sysroot)
# is not mounted as recursive shared on OSTree.  When the home
# directory in /etc/passwd is defined to use the symlink, then mounts
# in home are mounted on this /sysroot instead of /var.  That means
# that the mount does not propagate in Flatpak applications. This
# breaks Flatpak Builder and BuildStream which require fuse mounts.
HOME=/var/home
