"""Reads in a json file that lists "unmirrored sources", and tries to create
appropriate download mirrors.

IMPORTANT: Authentication:
    To create a git repository as a download mirror, you'll need at least
    maintainer access to the freedesktop-sdk/mirrors group. And to authenticate,
    you'll need to generate an access token "with API permissions", from Gitlab.

    To add a file to the tarball-lfs-mirror repository (as a download
    mirror for a tarball or zip archive), you'll need to have rights to push
    to that repository. If the script downloads a new copy of the
    tarball-lfs-mirror repository, you'll need an access token from Gitlab for
    this as well. (If you tell the script to use a copy of the repository that
    already exists on your machine, then it will assume you've already set up
    authentication credentials in the respository, and use those.

Background:
    The freedesktop-sdk project builds a lot of software which is downloaded
    from external source URLs, rather than included as part of the actual
    project repository. Buildstream allows the users to define download mirrors
    for these source URLs, by using aliases where the URLs are defined.

    The project has a goal to maintain our own download mirrors for most
    sources. These download mirrors are all hosted on a gitlab instance.
    (At time of writing, this is Gitlab.com. It that changes, then the constants
    defined at the top of this script will need to be changed.)

This script consumes the output of another script called "check_mirrors.py",
which generates a list of the sources that aren't currently mirrored. This
script reads that list as an input, and then tries to create appropriate
download mirrors.

Git repositories:
    If the source is a git repository, then the download mirror will be another
    git repository, hosted on a gitlab instance.

    We take advantage of the "groups" functionality on gitlab. We have a
    top_level group (At time of writing, this is
    https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/mirrors). Then we use subgroups (and
    sub-sub groups) to create repositories that have the apppropriate URL.

Git repo example:
        A raw URL, defined in a .bst file:
            foo:bar/baz.git
        has the alias "foo:"
        and resolves to an "original source" URL:
            https://foohub.com/bar/baz.git
        and resolves to a download mirror url:
            https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/mirrors/foo/bar/baz.git

    (Note that "bar/baz.git" (the part following the colon in the raw URL), is
    repeated in the source url and the mirror URL. Only the first part changes.)

    To create a project with the approriate mirror URL, we need to make a
    project called "baz", and place it in the "bar" group, which must be in the
    "foo" group, which must then be in the top level "mirrors" group.

    (Strictly speaking, 'mirrors' is a also a subgroup, of the freedesktop-sdk
    group. But for the purposes of this script, we refer to 'mirrors' as the
    'top' group.)

Tarballs, zip archives, and other files:
    If the source is a single downloadable file (a tarball, a zip archive, etc),
    then we provide a download mirror by storing a copy of the file in an lfs
    git repository. (At time of writing, this is
    https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/mirrors/tarball-lfs-mirror).

    To create the file, we need access to a local copy of that repository. The
    script then downloads the relevant file from the original source url, adds
    it to the local repository, creates a commit, and pushes the new commit to
    the remote repository.

    If you don't have an already-existing local copy, then the script can clone
    a new one. However, this can take a significant amount of time, so any
    maintainer who uses this script regularly should consider maintaining a
    persistant local copy of tarball-lfs-mirror.git.

Tarball example:
        A raw URL, defined in a .bst file:
            foo:bar/baz.tar.gz
        has the alias "foo:"
        and resolves to an "original source" URL:
            https://foohub.com/bar/baz.tar.gz
        and resolves to a download mirror url:
            https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/mirrors/tarball-lfs-mirror
            /raw/master/foo/bar/baz.tar.gz

    To create the download mirror, we download baz.tar.gz and put it in the
    folder "/foo/bar" in the repository. (Then we run git add, git commmit, and
    at the end, git push.)
