# This is the allow_list for the python script "check-static-libraries.py"
# Check-static-libraries.py will look for any files that end in ".a", and report failure if it finds any that are not on the list below.

# Format: files will only be recognised if you specify the full filename (no partial matches, no globs, no regular expressions)
# Format: enter the basename only, not any part of the directory path.

# Add the filenames below:

libc.a
libgcc.a
libgcov.a
libgcc_eh.a
libcaf_single.a
libc_nonshared.a

libnldbl_nonshared.a
#libnldbl_nonshared only seems to appear in app_ppc64le

libmvec_nonshared.a
#libmvec_nonshared only seems to appear in app_x86_64

libstdc++.a
# libstdc++.a is must for qtwebengine from kde runtime

# Begin glslang static libraries
libOSDependent.a
libOGLCompiler.a
# End glslang static libraries

# The script could potentially be extended to recognise globs, regular expressions, and/or partial directory paths. If you think this could be useful, please raise an issue on GitLab.
