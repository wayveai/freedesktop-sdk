# This script verifies RPATH/RUNPATH of executables and libraries in
# a sysroot. It looks and fails for:
#  1. useless RPATH that is the system library path (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu)
#  2. useless RPATH where no NEEDED library is present
#  3. relative RPATH paths
#  4. RPATH that do not exist.
#
# Notes:
#  - $ORIGIN is expanded and accepted as long as the resolved path exists.
#
#  - $LIB is not expanded. For now we expect it is not used because in
#    practice it is not used properly. So for now it will fail as the path
#    does not exist.
